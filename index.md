### About Me

I am an aspiring open source software contributer who recently graduated from Minnesota State University, Mankato with
a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I have experience programming in C, C++ and Java. However, I have the most experience with
Java as I first learned it way back in 2007. Below is a list of the projects I am currently doing or have done (will be uploading more coding projects
I have done in the past soon).

### Unix-to-Unix Encoder/Decoder / March 3, 2021

This is the source files to a uuencoder and uudecoder .cpp files that I originally submitted for 
my Fall 2019 computer science networking course on November 1, 2019. The project is [here.](https://github.com/KopperKnight/uue2019)

![UUE format converts any file to safe-for-transmission ascii text](kopperknightuue.gif)

You can compile the project into executable files typing "make" on the commandline in linux or windows in the root directory of the sources.

- If you are on windows you need to install [mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/) and add <mingw-location>\bin to your system PATH variable first. 
- if you are on linux you should have the C/C++ build tools already installed, otherwise on ubuntu specifically, you can install make/c/c++ compilers using the command 
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

- Additional, [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuencoding) is the wikipedia article on UUE format.

### Kopper Knight Tetris / February 17, 2021

A Tetris remake I put together one week in February 2021, using no third party libraries, in the Java Programming Language.

You can see the current API Javadoc [here](kopperknighttetris/index.html). If you have Java 11 installed on your desktop you can download the cross platform version. If you have a Windows Desktop and do not have Java 11 installed or are not sure. you can download the windows version. 


- [cross-platform-version](https://github.com/KopperKnight/KopperKnightTetris/releases/tag/0.212jar) 
- [Windows Version](https://github.com/KopperKnight/KopperKnightTetris/releases/tag/0.212win)
