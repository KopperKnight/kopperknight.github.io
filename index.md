# Kopper Knight Tetris

A Tetris remake made by me from scratch using the Java Programming Language.
You can see the current API Javadoc [here](kopperknighttetris/index.html) for documentation on how I implemented the game code. If you have Java 11 installed on your desktop (Windows/Linux/Mac) you can download the executable jar [here](https://github.com/KopperKnight/KopperKnightTetris/releases/tag/0.212jar) and execute it to play. If you have windows and do not have Java 11 on your desktop or are not sure, you can download a zipped version of the game [here](https://github.com/KopperKnight/KopperKnightTetris/releases/tag/0.212win) and unzip it in the desired directory and execute the kopperknighttetris.bat file to play. To uninsall this you simply delete the unzipped folder and its contents.


This is a work in progress for now. As my projects progress I will post them here.

In the meantime the default template filler will exist below this line.
